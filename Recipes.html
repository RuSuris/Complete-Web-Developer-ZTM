    <ol><li> <strong>Arroz con Pollo </strong></li>
        Ingredients: <br>    
        <ul>    <li>4 cloves garlic minced</li>
                <li>2 teaspoon red pepper flakes</li>
                <li>2 tablespoons lime juice</li>
                <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
                <li>1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
                <li>2 1/2 pounds chicken pieces skin on and bone in</li>
                <li>3 tablespoons olive oil</li>
                <li>4 cups chicken broth</li>
                <li>1/2 teaspoon saffron </li>
                <li>1 red onion chopped</li>
                <li>3 small bell peppers seeded and chopped</li>
                <li>15 ounce can of diced tomatoes</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon ground cumin</li>
                <li>2 bay leaves</li>
                <li>2 cups long-grain brown rice</li>
                <li>1 cup green olives halved</li>
                <li>cilantro for garnish</li>
        </ul>
                Cooking Instructions: <br>
                <ol>
                    <li>In a large bowl, stir together garlic, red pepper flakes, lime juice, salt and pepper. Add the chicken, toss to coat, and refrigerate for at least 1 hour or overnight.</li>
                    <li>In a large frying pan with a lid, heat olive oil over medium heat. Arrange chicken in the pan, skin side down, and cook without turning, until golden brown, about 10 minutes. Turn the chicken, cover the pan, and cook until golden brown on other side, about 10 minutes. Meanwhile, in a saucepan, warm broth over medium-high heat. Remove from heat and crumble in saffron; set aside.</li>
                    <li>Transfer chicken to a plate and pour off all but 2 tablespoons fat from the pan. Add the onion and bell peppers and sauté until softened, about 3 minutes. Add the tomatoes, cumin, bay leaves, and rice and cook, stirring constantly, until the rice has absorbed the juices, about 5 minutes. Pour the saffron broth into pan and stir. Place the chicken on top. Raise heat to medium-high and bring to a boil. Reduce heat to low, cover, and simmer 35 minutes, or until the chicken is cooked through, the rice is starting to get tender and about half of the liquid has been absorbed. Remove lid and cook until the rice is tender, and the liquid has been absorbed, about 10 to 15 additional minutes. Stir occasionally to prevent the rice from sticking to the bottom of the pan. Let stand for 5 minutes. Remove bay leaves. Top with olives and cilantro, as desired. Serve immediately.</li>
                </ol> <br>
        <li><strong>Cuban Sandwhich </strong></li>
            Ingredients: <br>
                <ul>
                    <li>1 loaf Cuban bread</li>
                    <li>1/4 cup yellow mustard</li>
                    <li>8 slices Swiss cheese, about 1/2 pound</li>
                    <li>16 slices maple glazed honey ham, about 1 pound</li>
                    <li>16 slices hot capicola, about 1 pound</li>
                    <li>8 – 12 slices dill pickle planks</li>
                    <li>4 tablespoons unsalted butter, softened</li>
                </ul>
            Cooking Instructions: <br>
            <ol>
                <li>If you are using a panini press, preheat to medium-high. (If do not have a press, you can use a sauté pan).</li>
                <li>Slice the loaf of bread into 4 equal pieces and then each piece lengthwise. Spread the butter on the outside of each half and then spread the mustard on the inside of each half.</li>
                <li>Cover the inside of each half with swiss cheese</li>
                <li>On one half of each sandwich, layer 4 slices of maple glazed honey ham and 4 slices of capicola.</li>
                <li>Place 2 -3 pickle planks on top of the ham and then close the sandwich.</li>
                <li>Place the sandwich in the panini press and place something heavy and heat proof, on top of the press (I use a sack of flour, but several cans of veggies will work too). Cook until the cheese is melted and the outside is crispy, about 5 minutes. If you are using a sauté pan, heat over medium-high heat. Transfer the sandwich to the pan and then place a flat-bottomed dish like a baking dish or smaller pot on top weighted with something heavy, like a sack of flour or canned food. Cook 2- 3 minutes per side</li>
                <li>Transfer the sandwich to a cutting board and slice in half. Serve and enjoy!</li>
            </ol> <br>
        <li><strong> Picadillo </strong></li>
            Ingredients: <br>
            <ul>
                <li>1 tablespoonolive oil</li>
                <li>1 medium onion (finely chopped)</li>
                <li>1 small red bell pepper (chopped)</li>
                <li>3 large cloves garlic (finely minced)</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon dried oregano</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon ground cumin</li>
                <li>1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon</li>
                <li>2 smallbay leaves</li>
                <li>1lb lean ground beef</li>
                <li>1/2 cup whole stewed tomatoes</li> 
                <li>1/3 cup dry white wine</li>
                <li>1 tablespoon tomato paste</li>
                <li>1 medium potato (cut into 1/2 inch cubes)</li>
                <li>1/3 cup raisins </li>
                <li> 1/2 teaspoonsalt</li>
                <li>1/2 cup stuffed green olives (coarsely chopped)</li>
                <li>1 tablespoon olive brine (to taste)</li>
            </ul>
            Cooking Instructions: <br>
            <ol>
                <li>Add the oil, onions, bell pepper, and garlic to a frying pan over medium heat and sauté until the onions are tender and starting to caramelize around the edges.</li>
                <li>Add the oregano, cumin, cinnamon and bay leaves, and sauté until very fragrant.</li>
                <li>Add the beef, tomatoes, wine, tomato paste, potatoes, raisins and salt and break up the meat and tomatoes using a spatula. Partially cover and simmer until the potatoes are tender (about 15 minutes)</li>
                <li>Remove the lid and add the olives. Let the picadillo cook until most of the liquid is gone, leaving a thick sauce that coats the beef (about 10 minutes).</li>
                <li>When the picadillo is finished, stir in the olive brine (liquid the olives came in) and adjust salt and pepper to taste.</li>
            </ol> <br>
        <li><strong> Yuca con Mojo </strong></li>
            Ingredients: <br>
            <ul>
                <li>1.5lbs frozen Yuca</li>
                <li>1 lime (juiced)</li>
                <li>1/2 tsp coarse salt</li>
                <li>1 cup mojo criollo sauce</li>
                <li>1 small yellow onion </li>
            </ul>
            Cooking Instructions: <br>
            <ol>
                <li>Add water, lime juice, and salt to a pot and bring to a boil. Carefully add yuca pieces and allow to return to a bubble then reduce heat. Let it cook uncovered for 20-30 minutes, or until easily pierced with a fork. As it cooks, the pieces will expand and some will crack open along the center.</li> 
                <li>While yuca is cooking, slice onion into thin rings.</li>
                <li>When you have about 5 minutes left to cook the yuca, begin preparing the mojo sauce. Pour sauce into a large frying pan with onion rings and allow to come to a gentle bubble to soften onions and gently cook the garlic. NOTE: If you don't have pre-made mojo or don't have access to sour oranges, you can use lime juice only in this recipe. Use the juice of about 4 limes, a few Tbsp of olive oil, 4-6 cloves of garlic (minced or pressed), and a generous pinch of salt, oregano, and ground black pepper to taste.</li>
                <li>Once yuca finishes cooking, be sure to remove the tough, stringy, fibrous core from each piece. There is NOTHING worse than biting into one of those while eating yuca. I usually just fish out each piece of yuca individually with a fork, remove the core, then add it to the frying pan one piece at a time.</li>
                <li>Add all of the cooked, cleaned yuca to the frying pan and toss to combine with the sauce. Let the flavors mingle for about 3-5 minutes, stirring a few times. The sauce will thicken during this time as some of the starch from the yuca cooks out. You will want to serve immediately as the texture will change as the yuca sits and cools. If you have leftovers, store them in the fridge in an airtight container.</li>
            </ol>
            <strong>Bonus:</strong>Try deep frying leftovers the following day for a second way to try out yuca (if you can manage save any!) <br>
            <br>
        <li><strong>Papas Rellenas </strong></li>
            Ingredients: <br>
            <ul>
                <li>4 large potatoes, peeled and cubed</li>
                <li>1 tbsp warm milk</li>
                <li>1 tsp salt</li>
                <li>2 eggs</li>
                <li>1 tbsp water</li>
                <li>1 cup dry bread crumbs</li>
                <li>1/4 cup all-purpose flour</li>
                <li>1 tbsp vegetable oil</li>
                <li>1 lb groung sirloin</li>
                <li>1 onion, finely chopped</li>
                <li>2 garlic cloves, peeled and chopped</li>
                <li>2 small green bell pepper, finely chopped (about 1 cup)</li>
                <li>2 small red bell pepper, finely chopped (about 1 cup)</li>
                <li>1 tsp freshly crackedblack pepper</li>
                <li>1 tsp paprika</li>
                <li>1 tsp cumin</li>
                <li>1 tsp dried oregano</li>
                <li>1 tbsp worchestire sauce</li>
                <li>1 lime, juiced</li>
                <li>vegetable oil for frying</li>
            </ul>
            Cooking Instructions: <br>
            <ol>
                <li>Boil the peeled and diced potatoes until they are fork tender. Drain. Mash potatoes with the salt and about 1 tablespoon of warm milk—do not add any butter or oil!—and let cool.</li>
                <li>In the meantime, make the filling. Heat a large heavy duty pot over medium high heat. Drizzle in the tablespoon of vegetable oil and add the ground sirloin. Using a wooden spoon, break up the beef and allow to cook and brown. Once browned, add the finely chopped onion and garlic. Stir and cook until the onions are translucent. Add the finely chopped green and red bell peppers. Stir and continue to cook. Season the beef mixture with the worchestire sauce, paprika, oregano, salt, pepper, cumin and lime juice. Stir thoroughly and continue to cook for 5 minutes more. Remove from heat and transfer to a bowl. Allow to cool completely.</li>
                <li>Using a medium ice cream scoop, measure out a ball onto the palm of your hand. Flatten out the ball into a flat circle with an indentation in the center.</li>
                <li>Stuff the indentation with the spiced beef mixture.</li>
                <li>Bring the sides together and smooth out to make a round ball, about the size of an overstuffed golf ball. Continue this process with the rest of the potato and beef mixtures, until all the balls are formed.</li>
                <li>In a shallow dish, whisk together the eggs and tablespoon of water.</li>
                <li>In another shallow dish, combine the bread crumbs and the flour.</li>
                <li>Dip the ball into the beaten egg, and then roll in the flour mixture until lightly covered. Dip the ball in the egg, again, and roll in the bread crumbs to coat thoroughly. Continue this process until each potato ball is coated, placing them on parchment lined baking sheets.</li>
                <li>It is very important to refrigerate the potato balls for 2 to 4 hours before proceeding to the next step. Or at this step, you can also freeze the balls and fry them later, when ready to eat.</li>
                <li>Use a frying pan or medium pot to fry the potato balls. Fill with enough oil to cover the potato balls. Heat oil to the frying stage (about 375º F) and drop about four potato balls (be careful not to overcrowd the pot) into the hot oil. Let them cook for about 2-5 minutes or until golden brown. Turn the potato balls frequently to ensure even browning.</li>
                <li>Transfer the fried potato balls to a plate lined with paper towels, to drain off the excess oil. Move the balls onto a rack positioned over a baking sheet. Serve right away, or allow to cool and store in the refrigerator. These can be fried ahead of time and reheated in the oven when ready to serve. Enjoy!</li>
